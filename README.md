# Car Features vs. Price & Profitability

## Project Overview
This project explores the impact of various car features on vehicle pricing and profitability. By analyzing factors like engine power, fuel efficiency, transmission type, body style, and market category, we identify key drivers of MSRP variations across different manufacturers and segments. The analysis utilizes **Excel** for data cleaning and statistical calculations and **Tableau** for interactive visualizations.

## Data Analysis Using Excel & Tableau

### **Excel Analysis**
- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Removed duplicates and missing values.
  - Addressed inconsistencies in `Engine HP`, `Engine Cylinders`, `Market Category`, and `Fuel Type`.
  - Outlier detection using **Z-score analysis** for `MSRP`, `Horsepower`, and `Fuel Efficiency`.

- **Statistical Calculations:**
  - Used **COUNTIF, AVERAGE, MEDIAN, STDEV** to analyze price trends and feature correlations.
  - Created pivot tables for **MSRP distribution by brand, body style, and market category**.
  - Visualized trends using **scatter plots, histograms, and box plots**.


## Tech Stack
- **Microsoft Excel 2022:** Data analysis, visualization, and statistical calculations.
- **Tableau:** Interactive data visualization.



## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into how different car features affect price and profitability. Manufacturers and dealers can leverage these findings to optimize feature offerings, pricing strategies, and marketing campaigns.
